## 2026-11-03 13:23 — Task 05 (P1.1): fix two bugs found by real use

**What I did.** Fixed the two known bugs in the `file_discovery` NLU, TDD
(tests first, then implementation).

*Bug 1 — silent slot dropping.* `lb show me the biggest files here` was
emitting `find . -type f` (matches everything): "biggest" is a size cue with
no numeric threshold, and the old code emitted `find_by_size` anyway, just
without a `size_bytes` slot. Added the abstention gate in `nlu.parse`: a size
cue with no number now returns `None` (abstain) instead of a thresholdless
frame. Added `nlu.abstain_hint`, which the CLI calls when `parse` returns
`None` to print a specific hint — `LinuxBuddy: how big? try "over 100MB"` —
rather than the generic "not sure what you mean". Also added a symmetric age
superlative cue (oldest/newest/latest/recent) → `how recent? try "in the
last 7 days"`, since the task groups those superlatives with the size ones.

*Bug 2 — plural extensions dropped.* `lb csvs bigger than 2 gigs` omitted
`-name '*.csv'`. Added a small explicit `_PLURAL_EXT` map (csvs→csv, logs→log,
pys→py, jsons→json, notebooks→ipynb, scripts→sh) plus a single trailing-s
fallback in `_normalize_ext` (so tsvs→tsv, pdfs→pdf come for free). "images"
is deliberately left out — ambiguous — and does not map. Not a stemmer, as the
task required.

**Decision the human should review.** Task 05's new rule ("`find_by_size`
with no `size_bytes` → abstain") and its required `"largest files" → None`
case directly reverse the *old* `test_vague_big_in_downloads` test, which
asserted that `"big files in downloads"` resolved to a thresholdless
`find_by_size`. "big" with no number is the same slot-dropping class as
"biggest", and CLAUDE.md invariant #6 (abstain over guess) backs the new
behavior, so I updated that test to assert `None` (renamed
`test_vague_big_in_downloads_now_abstains`) and reversed the stale
"vague-big resolution" rationale in the `nlu.py` module docstring. Flagging
it because it is a deliberate behavior change to a previously-passing test,
not just an addition.

**Tests.** Added to `tests/test_nlu.py`: biggest→None, largest→None,
`csvs bigger than 2 gigs`→(by_size, ext=csv, 2147483648),
`logs from today`→(by_time, ext=log, days=1); updated the vague-big test.
Added to `tests/test_cli.py`: the superlative abstain-with-hint path and the
plural-csv `-name` filter. The four original intent cases (size/time/name/
type) still pass. Full suite: **39 passed** (was 33).

**Real-shell checks (Done when).**
- `lb show me the biggest files here` → `LinuxBuddy: how big? try "over 100MB"`, exit 1 ✓
- `lb csvs bigger than 2 gigs` → `find . -type f -name '*.csv' -size +2147483648c`, exit 0 ✓
